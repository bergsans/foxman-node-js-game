# FOXMAN. A small node.js game

![foxman.gif](foxman.gif)

I've tried to mimic the enemy behavior in Pacman (this game is a part of the clone genre, fan fiction if you will) but skipped the part when Pacman becomes omnipotent. The enemies behavior has two modes, chasing and moving randomly.

For the ASCII art texts, I've used figlet and inlined the text in NeoVim,
```
:read !figlet -f 3d "Hello there, 3d text!"
```
...and I've used emojoicons for graphics.

## Setup
```
npm install

node src/foxman.js
```
